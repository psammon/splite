Backend Song I/O and Reccomendation Social Network

Reads song metadata from a directory
Data Structures:
-Max Heap
-BSTree
-Undirected Graph with V = users and E = friendships

Algorithms:
-BSTree management (add leaf, remove, print, etc.) // O(n)
-BSTree search // O(logn)
-Max Heap extract max / increase key / maxHeapify // O(logn)
-Djikstra's algorithm // O(|E|log|V|)

Interface:
-exit
-add user [username]
-friend [username] [username]
-unfriend [username] [username]
-listen [username] [song_title] [<n>] //n = #listens, increases song's listen count for the user
-set radius [<k>] //k = degree of friends to consider for reccomendations
-reccomend [<n>]//adds n most popular songs from friend's most listened to songs to primary user's library
-remove song [song_title]//remove song from primary user's library
-show songs //show primary user's music library
-show friends [user_name]
-show system //show the most popular songs among primary_user's friends to k'th degree radius
